# fisik_pixijs
## A simple physics-based game I made while learning JavaScript and Pixi JS.

~~Makes use of Pixi JS version <b>5.1.3</b>~~ Now updated to the <b>latest version</b> of Pixi JS.

### How do I run it?
(To be honest, you can use any IDE of your choice and figure running the project on your own. I personally think VS Code is more convenient.)
 - Assuming you have VS Code installed, open the project folder in VS Code and make sure you have the Live Server extension installed.
 - You should find a "Live Server" button at the bottom right. Click it and VS Code will start a server for your project with your browser.
 - Once it has been opened, click on "webpage.html" and congrats, you're now able to run the project.
 - Before running and checking if it works, make sure you have Node.js installed. You'll be needing this to install the latest version of Pixi in your project. In the VS Code terminal, type the following: -<br>
 ```npm install pixi.js```
 - It will take some time to install, but after that, you can now get down to business and fool around with the code.

Make sure you enable <b>hardware acceleration</b> in your browser.
